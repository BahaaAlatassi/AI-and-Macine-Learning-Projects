Implementing breadth-first search for a problem.
The problem scenario is the vacuum world.
The diagram is attached.
Each state has a number in red. I represent the states and transitions shown in the diagram in your program in some form. 
For example, state 1 expands to states 1, 2 and 3 (by the actions Left, Right and Suck). 
The purpose of the Vacuum cleaner is to find dirts and suck them after fetting to their position (node 7 and node8).
